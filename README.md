# Summary
C++ Standalone program that takes list of text inputs and centers them on an background image for an Instagram post.  
The project is still work in progress.  
Im making use of the SFML library.  

# Usage
1. First check the options file at: Resources/options.txt  
There are options to change resolution, text size and color, font and etc.  
  
2. The input texts should be written in: Resources/quotes.txt
In the options file you can chose a delimiter symbol to seperate the different inputs.

3. Run the program and the output images will be created in the "Output" folder.

# Planned features
1. Making an UI for the program.
2. Adding more ways to customise the image contents.
3. Make it able to choose text alignment.
